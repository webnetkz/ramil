					<description><![CDATA[I purchased the program a month ago. My last workout day was yesterday.
I really have big respect to this dude. The program is well explained, and considering that I&#039;ve got some good basic strength in calisthenics, I really found this program to be exactly tailored to my current level at the time.
I succeeded to perform all exercises and got to learn two new (Ice cream maker and dips ice cream maker). 

Last day (push and pull day) of fourth week is a killer! Only missed half of the last set.. I love it. 

Look guys, when you feel really sore although you&#039;ve been in the game for relatively a decent time, you really know you&#039;re gaining biiig time.

Larosa, cheers bro

I&#039;m now purchasing the advanced program.. looking forward to it

I&#039;ll also send before and after pictures when I&#039;m done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Havent bought the program yet, but am thinking about it, just have a few questions: 
1. What are the (2 steps) listed in the equipment needed?
2. I only just meet the requirements, so is it possible that I can repeat the weeks until I am strong enough to move on?
3. Is there skill training included in the program, as I want to learn skills like Handstand, L sit and Muscle up?]]></description>
